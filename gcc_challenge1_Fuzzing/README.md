# Automate Vulnerability Finding and Binary Exploitation
This challenge is intended to reveal your thinking and working process, how you tackled it.  
Please describe your process as much detail as possible.  
If you can't fill all answers, it's fine.  

Your goal is finding all inputs that crash the toy program (referred as "crash inputs") by automated manner.  
All challenges use simple_linter.c as a target program, located in same directory.

1. Find as many crash inputs as possible of simple_linter.c by using AFL and laf-intel. Describe the difference between them based on your observation.
2. Write your angr script which can find all crash inputs of simple_linter.c.
3. Does symbolic execution always work better than fuzzing in the context of vulnerability finding? Please explain the advantage/disadvantages between AFL, angr and Driller.
