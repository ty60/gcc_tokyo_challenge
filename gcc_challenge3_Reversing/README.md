# Advanced Binary Deobfuscation Pre-Challenge

This CTF-style challenge is intended for measuring your program analysis skills. 

1. Submit a solver which extracts the flag within the `vmgcc` program. Literally, this program employs a custom VM architecture.
2. Submit a disassembler for the `keycheck` bytecode. Analyzing `vmgcc` is required in advance.

Enjoy!
